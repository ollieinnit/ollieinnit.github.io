            <p class="text-2xl text-white">The FA Charter Standard programme has been assessing the ability of leagues to provide a high-quality, safe and enjoyable football experience against a standard set of criteria for the last 12 years (20 years in the case of clubs). It also encourages leagues to continuously develop through on-going support from County FA staff, as well as review and progress a league development plan.

            With this in mind, accreditation is awarded to clubs and leagues judged to be well run and sustainable, and which prioritise child protection, quality coaching and implementation of the Respect programme.

            After 20 years of running Charter Standard, the FA have updated the programme in order to remain fit for purpose, and has re-branded as England Football Accreditation starting in 2021.</p>

    <p class="text-white text-2xl">Galmington Dragons FC is proud to have been awarded Two Star Accreditation under the FA’s New England Football Framework.

Accredited Clubs exist for the players and creates opportunities for everyone to experience and enjoy the game we all love.

Accreditation is awarded to clubs that offer all players – whether male and / or female and / or disability players – across a range of ages the opportunity to fully access the best of football in well run, high quality, safe and sustainable environment, and fit for purpose League competitions.

Accredited clubs infrastructure is sound, robust, efficient and effective. They centre behaviours around the Respect standards and behaviours needed to make football in England something we can all be proud to be part of.

England Football Accredited is the new framework for League and Club accreditation, and replaces The FA Charter Standard. It is an opportunity for The FA and County FAs to recognise all Leagues and Clubs who raise the bar and set the tempo for football to thrive in England. It enables us to work with our League network to offer modern competitions that meet the needs of today’s game, while simultaneously creating maximum opportunities for everyone who enjoys the game to participate. Regardless of background, ability, skin colour, gender, sexual orientation or age: we unite everyone and strive to give the very best of ourselves.</p>
